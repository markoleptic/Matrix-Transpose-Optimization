09/22: 
 - Set up the project repository on GitLab.
 - Ran provided baseline code on GPELs, and set up Remote SSH for VS Code to allow for easier environment.
 - Discussed about SIMD, loop transformations, tiling, and memory traffic minimization and tried to understand the topics

09/26 
 - Continued to discuss about transposition topics
 - Check on each member to make sure we're on the same page.

09/01
 - Review and finalize the writeup, ensuring all sections are complete and well-explained.
